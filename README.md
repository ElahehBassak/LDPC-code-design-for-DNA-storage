This code is part of an on going project for design of efficient error correcting codes for DNA storage. In this code a regular LDPC code is constructed using the progressive edge growth construction method, and digital bits are encoded into two separate LDPC codes. The two encoded LDPC codewords are mapped into DNA symbols {A,C,G,T} and sent over the DNA storage channel. In this work the DNA storage channel is simulated to have the substitution errors common in DNA storage channels. Then the designed decoder will recover the original bits from the corrupted DNA symbols with high probability. The bit error rate function embedded in the code allows the user to check the relaibility of the proposed encding and decoding method for differetn hyperpapramters present in the code.
